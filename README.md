# pythonibbles
this repository has some (generally very basic) python snippets as I learn python for physical computing. the resource I use to learn is this online book: https://pythonnumericalmethods.studentorg.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html

do not expect any of this to be actually good code; it's essentially a collection of my digital notes from the book in preparation for first-year lab & computing, and anything thereafter. ^^
